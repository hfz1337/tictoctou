## Challenge information
**Challenge**: TicTocTou  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Category**: Pwn  
**Description**: Have you ever played the game named TicTocTou? Yeah, me too, I used to play it a lot during boring classes in primary school, because, you know, playing games changes your time's perception and the class ends faster!
